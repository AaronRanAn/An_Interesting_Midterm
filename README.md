### Welcome to this repo! 

This is the repo that stores my solution for the quant part of the HU ANALY 500 50 Mid-term. _Please contact me for the questions if you are interested_

**The purpose of this repo is only for my classmates who's interested in how to do this in R to have this as a reference to reinforce what we have learned so far in R.**

This repo will remain empty until the test is closed to make sure no one uses it for plagiarism. 

**This repo will also be closed immediately after this semester is over to make sure the test is re-usable and for academic integrity.**

A written solution for the quant part of the test could be found HERE.
